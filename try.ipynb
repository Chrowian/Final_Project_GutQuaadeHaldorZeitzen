       "'No comment is expected from Barack Obama Members of the  # FYF911 or  # FukYoFlag and  # BlackLivesMatter movements called for the lynching and hanging of white people and cops .  They encouraged others on a radio show Tuesday night to  turn the tide  and kill white people and cops to send a message about the killing of black people in America . One of the F *  *  * YoFlag organizers is called  Sunshine .   She has a radio blog show hosted from Texas called ,   Sunshine s F *  *  * ing Opinion Radio Show .  A snapshot of her  # FYF911  @ LOLatWhiteFear Twitter page at 9 : 53 p . m .  shows that she was urging supporters to  Call now !  !   # fyf911 tonight we continue to dismantle the illusion of white Below is a SNAPSHOT Twitter Radio Call Invite    # FYF911The radio show aired at 10 : 00 p . m .  eastern standard time . During the show ,  callers clearly call for  lynching  and  killing  of white people . A 2 : 39 minute clip from the radio show can be heard here .  It was provided to Breitbart Texas by someone who would like to be referred to as  Hannibal .   He has already received death threats as a result of interrupting  # FYF911 conference calls . An unidentified black man said  when those mother f *  * kers are by themselves ,  that s when when we should start f *  *  * ing them up .  Like they do us ,  when a bunch of them ni *  * ers takin  one of us out ,  that s how we should roll up .   He said ,   Cause we already roll up in gangs anyway .  There should be six or seven black mother f *  * ckers ,  see that white person ,  and then lynch their ass .  Let s turn the tables .  They conspired that if  cops started losing people ,   then  there will be a state of emergency .  He speculated that one of two things would happen ,   a big - ass [R s ?  ?  ?  ?  ? ] war ,   or  ni *  * ers ,  they are going to start backin  up .  We are already getting killed out here so what the f *  * k we got to lose ?  Sunshine could be heard saying ,   Yep ,  that s true .  That s so f *  * king true .  He said ,   We need to turn the tables on them .  Our kids are getting shot out here .  Somebody needs to become a sacrifice on their side . He said ,   Everybody ain t down for that s *  * t ,  or whatever ,  but like I say ,  everybody has a different position of war .   He continued ,   Because they don t give a f *  * k anyway .   He said again ,   We might as well utilized them for that s *  * t and turn the tables on these n *  * ers .  He said ,  that way  we can start lookin  like we ain t havin  that many casualties ,  and there can be more causalities on their side instead of ours .  They are out their killing black people ,  black lives don t matter ,  that s what those mother f *  * kers   so we got to make it matter to them .  Find a mother f *  * ker that is alone .  Snap his ass ,  and then f *  *  * in hang him from a damn tree .  Take a picture of it and then send it to the mother f *  * kers .  We  just need one example ,   and  then people will start watchin  .   This will turn the tables on s *  * t ,  he said .  He said this will start  a trickle - down effect .   He said that when one white person is hung and then they are just  flat - hanging ,   that will start the  trickle - down effect .   He continued ,   Black people are good at starting trends .  He said that was how  to get the upper - hand .  Another black man spoke up saying they needed to kill  cops that are killing us .  The first black male said ,   That will be the best method right there .  Breitbart Texas previously reported how Sunshine was upset when  racist white people  infiltrated and disrupted one of her conference calls .  She subsequently released the phone number of one of the infiltrators .  The veteran immediately started receiving threatening calls . One of the  # F *  *  * YoFlag movement supporters allegedly told a veteran who infiltrated their publicly posted conference call ,   We are going to rape and gut your pregnant wife ,  and your f *  *  * ing piece of sh * t unborn creature will be hung from a tree .  Breitbart Texas previously encountered Sunshine at a Sandra Bland protest at the Waller County Jail in Texas ,  where she said all white people should be killed .  She told journalists and photographers ,   You see this nappy - ass hair on my head ?    That means I am one of those more militant Negroes .   She said she was at the protest because  these redneck mother - f *  * kers murdered Sandra Bland because she had nappy hair like me .   # FYF911 black radicals say they will be holding the  imperial powers  that are actually responsible for the terrorist attacks on September 11th accountable on that day ,  as reported by Breitbart Texas .  There are several websites and Twitter handles for the movement .  Palmetto Star  describes himself as one of the head organizers .  He said in a YouTube video that supporters will be burning their symbols of  the illusion of their superiority ,   their  false white supremacy ,   like the American flag ,  the British flag ,  police uniforms ,  and Ku Klux Klan hoods . Sierra McGrone or  Nocturnus Libertus  posted ,   you too can help a young Afrikan clean their a *  *  with the rag of oppression .   She posted two photos ,  one that appears to be herself ,  and a photo of a black man ,  wiping their naked butts with the American flag . For entire story :  Breitbart News '"
